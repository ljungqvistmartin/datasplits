Custom splits of BDD100k dataset.

BDD100k dataset consists of 100,000 images. 20,000 out of the 100,000 images are reserved for the test set. Since the labels for the test set are unavailable, here the 80,000 images with public annotations are randomly divided into 60/20/20\% for training, validation, and testing in order to have three splits with annotations.
