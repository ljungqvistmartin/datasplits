Custom splits of BDD100k dataset.

BDD100k dataset consists of 100,000 images. 20,000 out of the 100,000 images are reserved for the test set. Since the labels for the test set are unavailable, here the remaining 80,000 images are randomly divided into 60/20/20\% for training, validation, and testing.
